## Confusion and Delay: A Bullet-Dodging Game

### Introduction
This project is intended for personal use. It was individually developed as a Christmas present for my younger brother, who is a fan of several of the characters featured. All graphics were created by myself. Music is sourced from YouTube.

### Description
The story begins as Thomas is not satisfied with working on Christmas. A shooting star hears his wish and allows him to battle his boss: Sir Tophamm Hatt. From there, the player controls Thomas as he dodges attacks from both his boss and his hat until he is able to achieve victory.

### Game Features
- **Character Movement:** Control the character by either flying or moving left/right against gravity.
- **Parry enemies:** Collect parry attacks in order to gain a power up.
- **Switch between attacks:** Either have a slow but more powerful attack or a faster, weaker one.
- **Music Selection:** Select from a variety of different tunes.
- **Two Different Bosses:** Select from an easy boss and a difficult one when a challenge is needed.
- **Fun Graphics:** General theme is meant to mimic the feel of classic cartoons from the 1920's.
