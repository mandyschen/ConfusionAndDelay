## Confusion and Delay: A Bullet-Dodging Game

### Introduction
This project is intended for personal use. It was individually developed as a Christmas present for my younger brother, who is a fan of several of the characters featured. All graphics were created by myself. Music is sourced from YouTube.

### Description
The player controls Thomas the Train using either arrow keys or WASD as he dodges several attacks from two enemies including Sir Tophamm and Hatt (his top hat). 

### Game Features
- **Character Movement:** Control the character by either flying or moving left/right against gravity.
- **Music Selection:** Select from a variety of different tunes.
- **Two Different Bosses:** Select from an easy boss and a difficult one when a challenge is needed.
- **Fun Graphics:** General theme is meant to mimic the feel of classic cartoons from the 1920's.
